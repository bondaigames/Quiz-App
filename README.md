“QuizNanda” is a quiz game that answers the mosaic image from four choices within the time limit. If you answer correctly, you will get points according to the remaining time, and you will win or lose against your opponent with a total score of 5 questions. Choose the topic you want to challenge from 16 quiz categories and the system will match your opponent. You can also call out to friends from LINE, Facebook, Twitter, and contact lists. 

You can also post your own image quiz on your favorite topic or create your own original topic. From light issues to cult issues, various topics and problem images are posted to create a community where people with common interests gather. 

In the future, topics that are sponsored by companies and organizations are also envisaged. For example, collaborations such as store image quizzes for convenience store chains and local image quizzes by local governments are possible. 

The image guessing quiz is easy to expand overseas because it has little language dependency, and we are planning to release a foreign language version at an early stage.
